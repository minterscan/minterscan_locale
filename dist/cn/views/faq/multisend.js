      <b>Minter Multisend</b> is a open source utility for sending Multisend transactions.

      <a href="https://github.com/shrpne" target="_blank">Nikita Eybog</a> and he did not
      find any obvious vulnerabilities for the leakage of a seed phrase or a private key.

      <p class="title is-size-6">Security</p>
      Despite the fact that the code is open and performs only one function - sending multisend transactions.
      And despite the fact that the code was analyzed by the developers of Minter.
      When working with your personal wallet <b>ALWAYS</b> follow security measures.
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a fresh wallet to send Multisend transactions</li>
        <li>Always keep the balance of this wallet equal to 0 BIP</li>
        <li>Transfer money to fresh wallet directly before sending a multisend transaction</li>
        <li>
          Use a browser without any extensions installed.
          Any extension that requires access to all tabs can potentially be dangerous.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
