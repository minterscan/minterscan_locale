      find any obvious vulnerabilities for the leakage of a seed phrase or a private key.

      <p class="title is-size-6">Security</p>
      Despite the fact that the code is open and performs only one function - sending multisend transactions.
      And despite the fact that the code was analyzed by the developers of Minter.
      When working with your personal wallet <b>ALWAYS</b> follow security measures.
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a fresh wallet to send Multisend transactions</li>
        <li>Always keep the balance of this wallet equal to 0 BIP</li>
        <li>Transfer money to fresh wallet directly before sending a multisend transaction</li>
        <li>
          Carefully check where you are downloading the archive with the utility.
          The only valid link is
          <a href="https://github.com/minterscan/minter_multisend" target="_blank">our Github profile</a>.
          We consciously do not make online version to eliminate the possibility of phishing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use a browser without any extensions installed.
          Any extension that requires access to all tabs can potentially be dangerous.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

      The code is open. We ask all developers to analyze the code and make their conclusion about its security.
      If you find a mistake, make a pull request on Github.
